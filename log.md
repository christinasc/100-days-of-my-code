**Today's Progress**: updated AWS beanstalk applications for farallon utility bills, created gmail API pull framework for pge email, also added pyCrypto for simple encryption of files. added cold room to biochem cold monitoring php pages. Need to pull the cold room once a week to update the data. 
**Thoughts**: second time around is easier, but also easy to forget how to create the client secret for the gmail API access and how to create the credentials. use "other" as the means for the client, don't use "web"

### Day 11: January 14, 2016 
**Today's Progress**: make mini python script to simplify checking for 100days in to a single line. Make future integration with slack to enable log update via slackbot command in claudia.js

### Day 10: January 13, 2016 
**Today's Progress**:  get slack delayed command to work. Figure out how to get webhooks to work with slackbot.
Discovered AWS workshop on serverless chatbots. Forking and working with this integration. hopefuly this will help me 
figure out how webhooks work as so far they are confusing.


### Day 9: January 12, 2016 
**Today's Progress**:

Getting tired of updating this log at the command line manually. 
Plan it to make it update via a slack bot command. Will write python script first as
standalone and then integrate with slack. Slack integration with Claudia.js seems
to be needlessly complex.  

### Day 8: January 11, 2016 
**Today's Progress**: 
Successfully deployed a chatbot through Viber. Still working through deployement on Facebook and Slack. They seem
to be a lot more complicated to deploy because multiple steps are required, including a webpage, a webhook, authorization 
process, oAuth, etc. 

Cloning the viber bot today and writing detailed setup instructions to avoid pitfalls. Trying additional commands for viberbot 
to make it more interesting. 


### Day 7: January 10, 2016 
**Today's Progress**: 
continue working on configuration for integrating Claudia.js examples with facebook, slack and viber

### Day 6: January 8, 2016 
**Today's Progress**: setup slackbot - example-bot. spent a lot of time trying to get IAM on AWS configured properly to run Claudia.js examples

### Day 5: January 7, 2016

### Day 3: January 5, 2016

**Link(s) to work**: 

### Day 2: January 4, 2016 
**Today's Progress**: forked Chatterbot and flask-chatterbot repos. ran examples. 
**Thoughts**: 
**Link(s) to work**: 

### Day 1: January 3, 2016 
**Today's Progress**: updated zipcode regex in application.py.
 not sure why regex examples weren't working. need more testing. 
**Thoughts**: committed after midnight . so result shows in github as Jan 4, not 3
